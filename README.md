What is our project?

We wanted to create a website where farmers can buy, sell, and view, waste produced by other farmers. Users will be able to Log-in (sign-up), see the home page which consists of listings from other farmers, and either buy or add their own listing. If they see one that intrests them, (note, what they will buy is another farmers waste) they will contact the seller. 




Why did we pick it?

Sustainability is the ability to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In the context of agriculture, sustainability means producing food in a way that is environmentally, socially, and economically responsible.

Food waste is a significant challenge to achieving sustainability in agriculture. Farmers are responsible for producing the majority of the world's food supply, but they also generate a significant amount of food waste. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, around one-third of all food produced globally is lost or wasted every year. This amounts to approximately 1.3 billion tons of food wasted annually.
